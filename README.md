## 2-String Problems

3. [Minimum Palindrome Partioning](https://github.com/vedantb/DP-Interviews/tree/746642c4896349114c442abf9ed439d6490a8193/Min-Palindrome-Partitioning/min-palindrome-partitioning-optimized.js)

   [From Leetcode solutions](https://github.com/vedantb/DP-Interviews/tree/746642c4896349114c442abf9ed439d6490a8193/Min-Palindrome-Partitioning/min-palindrome-partitioning-smart.js)

   \(Already posted as part of All Possible Cuts in All Possible Intervals For Choosing Last Operation\)

4. [Minimum Insertions To Form a Palindrome](https://github.com/vedantb/DP-Interviews/tree/746642c4896349114c442abf9ed439d6490a8193/Minimum-Insertion-To-Form-Palindrome/min-insertion-form-palindrome.js)

   You can always just find the Longest Palindromic subsequence and use that. `str.length - LPS.length` will also give you the same answer.

   Similarly, you can also use the Longest Common Subsequence technique. You need to do an LCS on `str` and `str.reverse()` and then `str.length - LCS(str, str.reverse())` will give you the same answer.
